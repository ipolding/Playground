Closely guarded
The head, or smaller lobe of the comet, is 2.5km by 2.5km by 2.0km. The "body" is described as being 4.1km by 3.2km by 1.3km(.

With the previously released mass of 10 billion tonnes and a density of 400kg per cubic metre, which I published last month, this makes for an object that has a volume of 25 cubic km.

Its rotation rate is also now known to at least six significant figures - at 12.4043 hours.

Mission scientists have taken almost two months to release Friday's very simple data-set.

In part, this is because they were trying to make very careful measurements of a highly irregular object. And, it should be said, not all of the comet is visible - parts are permanently in darkness.

But it also speaks to their desire to hold back information that has enormous intellectual primacy.

No-one has ever been this close to a comet before, and there are major discoveries to be made.)
