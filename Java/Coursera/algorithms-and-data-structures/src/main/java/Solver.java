/**
 * A Binary search tree is made up of Nodes
 * For this problem, each Node:
 * * a board
 * * the number of moves made to reach the board
 * * the previous search node.
 * <p/>
 * The Solution starts with a Priorty Queue with one board - the initial board, with no next board and 0 moves
 * <p/>
 * 1) Initialise the Queue
 * 2) Delete the minimum priority Node from the queue.
 * 3) Insert all neighbouring search nodes - those that can be reached in one move from the dequeued Node.
 * 4) Repeat until we have the dequeued the solution i.e. when the solution == the minumum.
 * <p/>
 * THIS SOLUTION HINGES ON PRIORITY!!
 * Hamming Priority == number of blocks in the wrong position + number of moves made to get there
 * Small number of blocks in wrong position == Good; Fewer moves to get there == BETTER.
 * <p/>
 * Manhattan Priority Function ==
 * sum of the manhattan distances (sum of the vertical and horizontal distance) *
 * from the blocks to their goal positions + number of moves *
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * For example, the Hamming and Manhattan priorities of the initial search node below are 5 and 10, respectively.
 * <p/>
 * 8  1  3        1  2  3     1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8    1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8
 * 4     2        4  5  6     ----------------------    ----------------------
 * 7  6  5        7  8        1  1  0  0  1  1  0  1    1  2  0  0  2  2  0  3
 * <p/>
 * initial          goal         Hamming = 5 + 0          Manhattan = 10 + 0
 * <p/>
 * Manhattan - position 1 is (1+0) away; position 2 is (1+1) away etc.
 * Hamming - 3 correct; 4 correct; 7 correct; rest wrong so distance is 8 - 3 == 5.
 * <p/>
 * Smaller the ranking, the closer we are to the solution!! Hence we delete the minimum!!
 * <p/>
 * We dequeue the MINIMUM; the MINIMUM is the BEST; hence BEST-FIRST SEARCH.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * We make a key observation: the total number of moves we need to make (including those already made) >= its priority
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * CRITICAL OPTIMIZATION
 * Don't enqueue a neighbor if its board is the same as the board of the previous search node.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * Game Tree
 * View the problem as a 'game tree'. Each node in the tree is a game state.
 * Root == initial gameboard
 * Internal nodes have already been processed.
 * Leaf nodes are maintained in a priority queue.
 * <p/>
 * Removed nodes children are added to the game tree and the priority queue.
