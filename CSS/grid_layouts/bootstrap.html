The Boostrap Bubble

The Public Bubble is run by and for young people on public sector graduate schemes. 

It aims to foster closer ties and share knowledge between public sector employees by running events for both networking and socialising. 

Participants include trainees on the Civil Service Fast Stream, the Local Government Associationâ€™s NGDP scheme, and Teach First.
